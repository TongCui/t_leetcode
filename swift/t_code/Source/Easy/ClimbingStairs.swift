     You are climbing a stair case. It takes n steps to reach to the top.
 
     Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?
 
     Note: Given n will be a positive integer.
 
     Example 1:
 
     Input: 2
     Output: 2
     Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
     1. 1 step + 1 step
     2. 2 steps
     Example 2:
 
     Input: 3
     Output: 3
     Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
     1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
     2. 1 step + 2 steps
     3. 2 steps + 1 step
